### Python Data Wrangling
> This course teaches some of the building blocks for handling data in Python. We will show how to parse and manipulate data using Numpy and Pandas, and perform interactive visualization with Plotly. We analyze a real dataset using Scipy, demonstrating how to perform basic statistical tasks in Python.

-----------------------------------------------------

### Intro to Data Visualization 
> This course introduces the matplotlib library for doing visualization in Python. Students will start by learning about drawing scatter plot, and gradually explore how matplotlib interacts with Pandas. Also, we will introduce the alternative libraries for matplotlib in python and compare the differences.

### Intro to Machine Learning in Python with Scikit-learn
> This course introduces the Scikit-learn library for doing machine learning in Python. Students will start by learning about support vector machines, and gradually explore how Scikit-learn allows you to build a full machine learning pipeline, from feature extraction all the way through to prediction.

-----------------------------------------------------
### Building Neural Networks with Keras
> Neural networks are becoming an increasingly important tool in machine learning. In this short course, we demonstrate how to rapidly prototype an artificial neural network (ANN) in Python using the Keras library. We briefly introduce ANNs, including important variations like convolutional networks. Using Keras, students will build their own networks for some basic machine learning problems.

## Workshop pre-requisites <a id="prereqs"></a>

This workshop is designed to give beginners the practical skills when examples and exercises emphasize how these techniques can be applied to real-world situations and use cases. So, previous math or coding experience is not required! 

## Required software <a id="required-software"></a>
In this workshop, we will use Google Colab.
